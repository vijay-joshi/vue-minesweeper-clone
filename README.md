# vue-minesweeper-clone

This is an attempt to create the classic Windows game minesweeper using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org). It is in its initial stage as of now. Will try to update and finish it as soon as I can.

So far, we have placed the mines and based on those, number of mines adjacent to a cell are visible.

Once it is complete, I will write a fully detailed article series based on this at [my blog](https://vijayjoshi.org). Minesweeper is an intermediate level program and it will be a practical example for developers to learn VueJS in the process.
