# vue-minesweeper-clone

This is an attempt to create the classic Windows game minesweeper using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org). It is in its initial stage as of now. Will try to update and finish it as soon as I can.

So far, we have placed the mines and based on those, number of mines adjacent to a cell are visible. Next is the code for handling clicks(both left and right). Once it is done and the game is complete, then we will work towards beautifying it using CSS.

Once it is complete, I will write a fully detailed article series based on this at [my blog](https://vijayjoshi.org). Minesweeper is an intermediate level program and it will be a practical example for developers to learn VueJS in the process.
